Act as a frontend web developer and design a searchable glossary using only HTML and Javascript. Please don't link to external styles or javascript libraries. The glossary needs to:
- display a list of words with a definition using detail summary tags
- have a search form for users to enter words to search
- filter the list of words based on what the user entered into the search
- Include 3 words with a definition on the topic of Calculus for a High School Student

Please output the HTML and Javascript together in one file. Here in an example:
<html>
<head>
<script>
// Insert Javascript here
</script>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Insert HTML Here -->
</body>
</html>

Please output in the code editor so that I can copy all the code as a single file.
