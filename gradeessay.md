Climate change is a big problam that is hapening right now. It is mainly caused by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbondioxide and methane in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, and as they build up, they make the Earth's temprature rise. This is called global warming, and it has many negative impacts on our world.

One of the most obvius effects of climate change is the melting of the ice in the polar regions. As the temprature of the Earth increse, the ice in the Arctic and Antarctic start to melt. This causes sea levels to rise, and as a result, many coastal ares and islands could be fluded in the future. This is a big worry for many people who live near the coasts, and it could lead to the loss of homes and even entire cities. Another consequece of the melting ice is the loss of habitat for animals like polar bears and pengiuns, who depend on the ice to survive.
