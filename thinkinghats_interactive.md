Act as a frontend web developer and design a 6 Thinking Hats activity using only HTML and Javascript. Please don't link to external styles or javascript libraries. 

Here is a description for each Hat and the view or perspective of the Hat:
White Hat - Facts, objective information, data
Red Hat - Feelings, emotions
Yellow Hat - Positives, advantages, benefits
Black Hat - Caution, concern, alert
Green Hat - Creativity, generate new ideas
Blue Hat - What have we done so far, summaries, suggest next steps

The activity needs to:
- display a heading that says "Thinking Hats Activity"
- display a question that says "Buying an electric car"
- randomly select a Hat for the learner and tell them to use this hat and respond to the topic in a multiline text box. Tell the learner about the perspective/view the hat must take. Include a submit button.
- Once the student clicks the submit button, display a table (with borders) with two columns namely Hat and Views. Each row will list a hat from the  5 other Hats  (i.e. the Hats that were not assigned to the learner) and views you will generate based on the view each hat must take for the topic ("Buying an electric car"). Display an icon next to the Hat name that is the svg for a hat icon and has the colour of the hat.

Please output the HTML and Javascript together in one file. Here is an example:
<html>
<head>
<script>
// Insert Javascript here
</script>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Insert HTML Here -->
</body>
</html>

Please output in the code editor so that I can copy all the code as a single file. This is really important.
