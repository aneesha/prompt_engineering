Please act as a mathematics subject area expert and brainstorm the main topics that a high school students needs to know on derivative rules.

Can you convert the topics and subtopics to the mermaid.js tab format for a mindmap?  Here is an an example of the format. At each heading level there needs to be a tabbed indent to match the section level: Here is an an example of the format:

mindmap
  root((mindmap name))
    Topic 1
      Sub-topic of topic 1
    Topic 2
      Sub-topic of topic 2

Please display the mindmap text your code editor so that I can copy the text.
